## HKCM
Hollow Knight Controller Masher (HKCM) is a tool for Hollow Knight speedrunners using a controller to mash through text boxes more quickly and easily. Makes use of [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/) and [ViGEmClient](https://github.com/CasualX/vigem-client) to send mashing inputs to a virtual controller on command.

## How to Install
### Windows
First, you must install the [ViGEmBus driver](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases). This is necessary for the controller emulation to function.
Then, install HKCM.exe from the [Releases page](https://github.com/cjonas1999/HKCM/releases).

## Usage Guide
After installing, press the 'Configure' button and hold the three buttons which correspond to nail, jump, and heal to set the mashing triggers. Then once ingame, if an active textbox is detected, holding these three buttons will mash the corresponding inputs until the text box closes.
